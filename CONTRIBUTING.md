# How To Contribute

Thank you for considering contributing to the Kotlin-Template project. Your support and
contributions are essential to the project's success and the broader open-source community. Below
you will find guidelines on how to report issues, propose new features, and submit contributions via
Pull Requests (PRs).

### Before You Start, File an Issue

Before diving into coding, if you have discovered an issue, have a question, or would like to
propose a new feature, please file an issue **BEFORE** you start working on it.

#### Search Existing Issues First

It's possible that someone else has already reported the issue or suggested the feature you have in
mind. Please take a moment to search through the existing issues (both open and closed) to check if
your issue or idea has already been addressed. This helps avoid duplicate efforts and cluttering the
issue tracker.

If no existing issue covers your concern, feel free to open a new one.
